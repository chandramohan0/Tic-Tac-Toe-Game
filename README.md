# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C++ compiler.

2. A 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board will be displayed.

3. The first player will be X. They will be prompted to enter a row (1-3) and a column (1-3) to place their mark.

4. The second player will be O. They will be prompted to enter a row (1-3) and a column (1-3) to place their mark.

5. The game will continue until one player wins by getting three in a row, or there is a tie (match drawn).

6. The program will display the winning player or a message indicating a match draw.

## Features

* Displays the Tic Tac Toe board and prompts players to enter their moves.

* Checks for valid moves and prevents players from selecting an already occupied spot.

* Alternates players after each turn.

* Checks for a win or a draw and ends the game accordingly.

## Limitations

* This is a command-line implementation and does not have any graphical user interface.

* The game is limited to two human players.

* The code does not include any tests or error handling.

## Future Improvements

* Implement a graphical user interface using a library such as SDL or SFML.

* Add support for playing against a computer opponent.

* Implement unit tests and error handling to improve code robustness.
